# Lost Souls

> Escape the cursed medieval maze. Avoid the phantoms. Find the portal. Survive.

## 📖 Story

You awaken in a cold, dark labyrinth with no memory of how you arrived. Brick walls surround you, lit only by flickering torches. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you notice ghostly figures floating through the corridors—phantom guardians that have claimed this maze as their eternal domain.

Your heart pounds as you realize the truth: you must escape before they find you. Scattered throughout the labyrinth are mystical orbs and metallic hearts—remnants of those who came before. The hearts will sustain your life force, but you only have three chances. Somewhere in this cursed place lies a portal, your only hope for freedom.

The phantoms are stirring. Time to move.
